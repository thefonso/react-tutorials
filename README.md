This is a fork of work by [willrstern](https://github.com/learncodeacademy/react-js-tutorials)

and based on his reactJS videos on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhkGQAoc7bc&t=3s) 

## The Problem

At the time of writing this readme the original source code... 

- did not match the beginnings of each video making it difficult for learners to follow along with videos in real-time

## The Solution

I have updated the code and split each segment up to match the videos

- tutorial modules are divided into branches
- each branch contains a readme with Video info
- code matches beginning of videos


## best way to download
do a local 

```$xslt
git clone https://github.com/thefonso/react-tutorials.git
```

view the branches at command prompt

```$xslt
git branch
```

each branch is numbered just switch to the next branch


```$xslt
git checkout name-of-branch"
```
